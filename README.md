# Category Filter with Animated Brand Display

This repository contains a category filtering project developed during my training period. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project features a category page that displays a list of brands. Users can filter brands by selecting a category, which will show only the relevant brands while others disappear with a CSS animation effect.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create an interactive category filter for displaying brands based on user selection. This exercise allowed me to gain experience with JavaScript for filtering functionality and to apply CSS animations for smooth transition effects when displaying and hiding brands. The project enhanced my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS animations.
